# Social Media Red Flags

A perspective on interactions in social media.

## What is this site?

This site aims to offer some perspectives of specific online behaviors. These
behaviors may indicate a user on social media is either not considering a
subject in good faith, or has ill intentions with the audience.  We call these
"red flags" since they are very visible warnings that may be obvious to some
but undetected by the people that need the warning the most.

## So, like a fact-checker?

Not exactly. While people who spread mis- and disinformation online
do so with lies and fabrications, simply fact checking them is largely unproductive.
People with ill intentions already have defenses ready to dispute any fact-checking,
so arming people with information on patterns of behavior may be more effective.

This site only aims to make people a bit more skeptical in how they consume
and share social media posts. Bad actors are not limited to one political leaning,
candidate, or issue.

## So, you're just trying to silence some political angle?

Not at all. With some exceptions, none of these red flags by themselves signify
ill intent. There are a wide variety of personalities, opinions, and perspectives
online, and we should be respectful of reasonable opinions, and be prepared to
discuss them reasonably. The red flags mostly center around when someone is pushing
reason to the sidelines.

## You're some \<INSERT-AD-HOMINEM-CHARACTERIZATION\> shill.

That's not a question.

## What spurred all this on?

The looming 2020 presidential election in the United States and the emergence of
the COVID-19 virus around the world.  While people are aware of bad actors and
propaganda, and often do their best to avoid sharing posts from people that run
counter to their biases, the opposite is true when bad actors embrace a person's
biases.

Everyone has biases and should not be afraid to examine them. We also should not
let our humanity get lost in the fight to be right on the internet and get likes.

## But what if they're REALLY wrong?

I would encourage you to read up on [Pyrrhic Victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory).

## I disagree with everything you're doing here.

Ok.

## How do we use this site?

When you see a post that shows some bad behavior, share a link from this site to the
comments of that post, and do nothing else. Do not reply to the original poster's
follow-ups or replies. Do not engage. Additionally, practice safe social media
practices, which includes blocking users and only divulging necessary private
information.

I would encourage people to use this site mostly with problematic posts that run
with their biases.  Someone who just red-flags people they don't agree with should
be considered leaning towards being a bad actor.
