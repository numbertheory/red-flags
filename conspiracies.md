Conspiracy theories do provide some comfort and even levity in moments of crisis. It's
more comforting to think that powerful intentional forces are at work, rather than
just uncontrolled randomness. Even if someone thinks a powerful force is out to get them,
at least that's something a person can reason with. The randomness of chance encounters,
natural phenonmena, or just sheer luck is terrifying for people trying to make sense
of the world and find order.

So, what's the harm? Plenty. Conspiracy theories often set sights on the "others" of societies:
people with unusual customs, language, skin color, religion, etc. They are used to radicalize
people against welcoming other cultures and ways of thinking. They are a useful tool to keep
a status quo of mistrust, and to divide communities that would otherwise be united.

Conspiracy theories directed at the powerful are also not without harm. They can be used
to terrify a group of people that a situation is hopeless, and to extinguish hope that
things will get better. They can be used to ensure groups of people don't get the help
they need, and in times of emergency, that can cost people's lives.

Finally, conspiracy theories are a weak way to explain away a fault with a system of thinking.
People who spread misinformation either use existing conspiracy theories to support their
outrageous claims, or dismiss all criticism as being "just a conspiracy theory," refusing
to engage in any critical analysis of their world view.
