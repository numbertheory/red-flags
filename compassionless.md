# Compassionless

“Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself.”

People sometimes present a "brave face" when confronted with a crisis. They may
think of their stoicism as a virtue, the path to being clear-headed and making
rational decisions when they are most needed. People have a variety of justifications
for this position, and sometimes that level of fairness is exactly what is
needed in a specific situation.

However, this can also manifest as a complete lack of compassion for others in all
situations.  It is not, and never has been, a strength to argue for a position
that would create second-class of citizen, only serve those lucky enough to be
born in healthy bodies, or make a life so hard to live that giving up seems like
an option. If you encounter, or promote, this kind of behavior, it is incumbent
on you to stop it.
